Abstract: This year marks the 35th anniversary of Professor Walter Wahli’s discovery of the PPARs (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors) family of nuclear hormone receptors. To mark the occasion, the editors of the scientific periodical Biomolecules decided to publish a special issue in his honor. This paper summarizes what is known about PPARs and shows how trends have changed and how research on PPARs has evolved. The article also highlights the importance of PPARs and what role they play in various diseases and ailments. The paper is in a mixed form; essentially it is a review article, but it has been enriched with the results of our experiments. The selection of works was subjective, as there are more than 200,000 publications in the PubMed database alone. First, all papers done on an animal model were discarded at the outset. What remained was still far too large to describe directly. Therefore, only papers that were outstanding, groundbreaking, or simply interesting were described and briefly commented on. 
Keywords: PPARs; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; clinical application; experimental therapy 
1. Introduction 
It is widely believed that the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) was described around 1974 by Prof. Walter Wahli. Unfortunately, among his 350 or so published papers, the fundamental, foundational, and pioneering work could not be found (and as there are at least two other contenders for priority [1,2]), we asked Prof. Walter Wahli for a statement on this matter. In response, Prof. W. Wahli identified one of his papers as the first (starting) paper on this topic, indirectly confirming his priority and providing its biographical data [3]. The paper cited is from March 1992 and concerns not a human but the amphibian Xenopus laevis, which, incidentally, explains our difficulty in finding it, since PubMed lists, at the time of writing these words, over 300,000 abstracts and full-text papers dealing with PPARs.

1.1. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha (PPARα) 
PPARα is a ligand-activated transcriptional factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor 
superfamily. It is also known as N1C1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group C, member 1). PPARα is strongly expressed in tissues with elevated fatty acid catabolism, such as the liver, 
heart, skeletal muscles, brown adipose tissue, and intestine. It regulates the transcription 
of multiple genes involved in the intracellular metabolism of lipids and is a major regu 
lator of fatty acid and triglyceride homeostasis [9–11]. PPAR-alpha performs the direct 
transcriptional control of genes implicated in mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation

tation can cause multistep disorders leading to the development of metabolic syndrome 
and atherosclerosis is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gene γ (PPARG). This 
gene is located on chromosome 3p25. Its expression can start from different promoters, 
depending on the site of origin, which results in the possibility of 3 isoforms of this receptor 
protein: PPARγ-1 (adipose tissue, muscle, heart, liver), PPARγ-2 (mainly adipose tissue), and PPARγ-3 (adipose tissue and colon). The expression of the PPARγ gene depends 
on, among other things, insulin and food availability, especially free fatty acids. PPARγ 
modulates insulin sensitivity and immune system activity by controlling the transcription 
of many proteins essential for carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. PPAR-gamma agonists 
in type 2 diabetes resulted in lower serum levels of pro-inflammatory markers, such as 
CRP, white blood cells, soluble CD40, MMP-9, amyloid A, and TNFα [15]. 
1.4. Pan-PPAR (Alpha, Beta/Delta, Gamma) 
The phenomenon of the combined treatment of several seemingly separate (if only 
partially) phenomena bears the prefix “pan-” in the case of the receptors described; it 
is about pan-ligands (usually agonists) and pan-PPARs. This phenomenon has been 
discovered and described as many as three times, yet it is little known and rarely used. The 
term “pan-PPAR” was noted for the first time in a paper by Cullingford et al. from 2002 [16]. It appeared for the second time in the literature reviewed in a 2007 paper by Rudolph 
et al. [17]. The authors treated all three PPAR isoforms (alpha, beta/delta, and gamma) 
together, indirect evidence of which is the new term “pan agonist”. Notwithstanding the 
above, three years later, Huang et al. [18] stated for the third time that separate testing of 
individual alpha, beta/delta, and gamma activities is incorrect, as the sum of the activities 
of all three isoforms should be considered. As an argument, they cited that using one of 
the experimental ligands initially significantly reduces, by decreasing the PPARα activity, 
the rate of cancer cell proliferation. Still, the subsequent increase in activity within the 
pan-PPAR phenomenon, specifically PPAR-gamma activity, spoils the whole effect (Table 1).

3 ↓ activity ↑ activity ↓ activity 
2. Aim of the Work 
Of particular note is that about 300,000 papers have been published on PPARs. This is 
undoubtedly an important topic that should be studied in depth. The published works go 
in different directions in learning about PPARs and sometimes the research results duplicate 
each other, thus supporting the validity and correctness of the results obtained by other 
research teams. This article was written to systematize and collect the existing knowledge 
about PPARs. It used the following databases: PubMed, EBSCO, Scopus, OMIM, and 
Google Scholar. By demonstrating the current state of knowledge, it is hoped that this work 
will contribute to better research planning, reduce unnecessary repetition, accelerate the 
growth of knowledge, and produce more interesting results.

No restrictions were placed on language.

Discoveries about PPARs were searched using the terms: “pharmacological PPAR 
targeting”, “PPAR discoveries”, “medical PPAR investigations”, “peroxisome proliferator activated receptor”, “PPAR AND Human”, PPARs AND disease”. 
Free-text searches for all PPARs (α, β/δ, and γ) and pan-PPAR activity were linked to 
the terms agonist, modulator, stimulator, and activator using a proximity search so that 
both terms (e.g., “PPAR” and “agonist”) had to occur within five words of each other. 
Reference lists of included original studies and relevant review articles obtained from 
the systematic search were manually reviewed to look for papers scientifically important or 
interesting to the authors. When a paper was deemed potentially relevant after reviewing 
the title and abstract, the full text of the study was downloaded. The literature search 
successfully identified relevant studies, some of which (285 papers) were included in this 
full-text review. The selection of cited papers was strictly subjective. 
3.3. Calendar with Commentary 
In 1989, 10 new papers arrived. Of these, we were particularly interested in the 
publication of Liu et al. [23], in which the authors demonstrate that replacing brown 
marrow with yellow marrow takes place under the control of PPARγ. 
The years 1990–1991 did not bring much work regarding the study of PPARs in 
humans. Animal models (mice, horses) were mainly studied. Anyway, it is worth noticing 
the paper of Issemann & Green [2], where authors activated PPARs with growth factors, 
and Alvares et al. [24], who identified the heat shock protein HSP70 as a new possible 
member of the PPARs superfamily. 
The year 1992: in this year, only 10 papers were published, among which, in our 
opinion, the work of Maksymowich et al. [25] should be singled out. They detected in 
all members of the steroid receptor superfamily (which form heterodimers with PPARs) 
a common conserved motif (the DNA sequence), which gives us hope for the future 
generation of pan-agonist or pan-antagonist PPARs. Then Gottlichet et al. found that 
chimeric ligands also work [26]. 
The year 1993 was one in which 29 new papers appeared in the PubMed database, 
among which it is worth mentioning the following: The paper by Keller and Wahli [27], 
whose authors see the links between endocrinology and dietetics on the grounds of PPARs. The works of Keller et al. [28] and Issemann et al. [29] in which the role of 9-cis retinoic 
acid in the activation and regulation of PPARs was demonstrated, and it was established 
that the mechanism leads through the binding of the said ligand to RXR. The work of 
Bardot et al. [30], whose authors studied PPAR-RXR heterodimers and acyl CoA oxidase 
and cytochrome P450 IVA6. The work of Boie et al. [31], whose authors tested the activity of 
enantiomers of known ligands. The work of Motojima [32], in which the author describes 
the various functions of PPARs and their activation mechanism. In the paper by Sher 
et al. [33], the authors describe the results of molecular studies, including cloning. Also 
interesting is the work of Bass [34], in which the author considers whether the functions 
performed by PPARs are more general or more specialized, and Gibson [35], in which 
he considers the future of PPARs. However, we were most impressed by the paper by 
Chen et al. [36], in which the authors claim to have evidence that there are not three 
PPARs but as many as five. If their argument is widely accepted, we are in for another 
nomenclature revolution, in which case the problems arising from the withdrawal of 
one receptor (beta/delta) will turn out to be a trifle indeed. 
In 1994, 33 new papers were published, of which we highlighted the work of Kainu 
et al. [37], who demonstrated the brain receptor PPARα. In 2009, Aleshin et al. [38] 
confirmed this in rat brains. In addition, they revealed the presence of other isoforms in the 
brain, as did the work of Lemberger et al. [39], which showed that stress hormones could 
be ligands of PPARs. 
In 1995, 49 new papers appeared, of which the following caught our attention: The 
work of Wahli et al. [40], in which the authors extensively discuss the panorama of lipid 
metabolism and its relationship with PPARs. The work of Gustafsson [41] in which it was
Biomolecules 2024, 14, 786 7 of 34 
pointed out that the toxicity of ligands may be a result of their binding to the receptor. The work of Bocos et al. [42] was repeated the following year by Lemberger et al. [43] 
(co-authored with W. Wahli), in which the authors found that fatty acids alone can activate 
PPARs. The paper by Yu et al. [44] described a new activator, HETEs, and its unusual 
properties. The paper by Keller et al. [45] (co-authored by W. Wahli), whose authors detail 
the role of RXRs in PPARs activation. The work of Juge-Aubry (co-author Wahli) [46], 
which considers the effect of thyroid hormone receptors, and the work of Baes et al. [47], who studied not an agonist but a PPAR-alpha antagonist. 
The year 1996 brought 66 interesting publications, of which we would like to mention 
the following: The papers by Formann et al. [48] and Wilson et al. [49] in which the authors 
describe ligands and activators of PPARs, and the paper by Gibson, in which the author 
tries to anticipate the future of PPARs. In the Aubert et al. [50] paper, the authors describe 
the first activator from a new family (thiazolidinediones). The paper by Patel et al. [51] is 
one in which the authors show that thiazolidinediones brilliantly activate PPARγ but, on 
the other hand, promote atherosclerosis. Then there is the paper in which Brun et al. [52] 
analyze the differences between the response to the same stimulus of different isoforms of 
the receptors studied. 
In 1997, 100 new papers arrived, and here are the most important among them: The 
paper by Guan et al. [53] reporting the presence of PPAR receptors in the human ureter, potentially bringing PPARs into the orbit of urology. In addition to these is the work of 
Bernlohr et al. [54], describing extracellular proteins and lipid transporters; the work of 
Clarke and Jump [55] with a description of an independent novel mechanism of PPAR 
activation by polyunsaturated fatty acids (at this point, one can make a loose hypothesis 
that this could be one of the reasons for the beneficial effects of PPARs on human health); 
and the work of Rove [56] on retinoid X receptors. 
The year 1998 enriched our knowledge about PPARs with the results of 156 works, the 
most important of which, in our opinion, worked on the role of PPARs in the functioning 
of blood vessel walls [57] and skeletal muscles [58] as well as the impact of PPARs on 
lipid metabolism at the receptor and gene expression levels [59–63]. This has expanded 
our knowledge about the role of PPARs in metabolic syndrome and the development of 
atherosclerosis in humans. The inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis by 
PPAR agonists was first demonstrated in human breast cancer cells [64]. In the same year, 
Sorensen et al. leaned into the problem of precisely controlling the activity of circumstantial 
PPARs, which takes on great importance in light of the planned preclinical studies [65], and 
Goodman found three independent connections between retinoids and schizophrenia [66]. The year 1999 brought us 233 new publications to read, many of which concerned 
the effects of PPARγ agonists on the growth and differentiation of human cancer cells in 
cancer tissues (ureter, bladder, prostate, liposarcoma) or cell lines such as colon cancer cells, 
T-cell lymphoma, or breast cancer cell lines [67–71]. The human T-cell leukemia retrovirus 
tax protein is a repressor of nuclear receptor signaling [72]. A possible role of reduced 
PPARγ activation by 15-HETE in the development or progression of prostate cancer has 
been suspected [73]. 
In 2000, there were 339 new interesting papers to review and evaluate. Lazennec G. 
and Wahli W. et al. observed a protein kinase A-dependent enhancement of the activity of 
all PPARα, β, and γ isotypes on two distinct promoters. Moreover, PKA inhibitors repress 
the PPAR ligands’ effect, suggesting that these ligands act partly by recruiting the PKA 
pathway. These findings highlight the involvement of the PKA pathway in PPAR action and 
indicate that it is essential for regulating gene activation by PPAR ligands [74]. Kawahito 
and co-authors demonstrated that the synovial lining layer, fibroblasts, and endothelial 
cells show expression of PPARγ in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and suggested 
that PPARγ may be an essential immunoinflammatory mediator and its ligands, especially 
15d-PGJ2, may be helpful in the treatment of RA [75]. Much attention has been paid to the 
role of PPARs in oncogenesis, including PPARδ in human endometrial adenocarcinoma 
and colorectal cancer [76–78] and PPARγ in gastric or prostate cancer [79,80].
Biomolecules 2024, 14, 786 8 of 34 
In exciting publications, Combs et al. showed that PPARγ agonists inhibit the β 
amyloid-stimulated expression of the cytokine genes interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis 
factor α, which brings us closer to the mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease [81]. In contrast, 
Zhou et al. drew attention to the over-representation of PPARγ sequence variants in 
sporadic cases of glioblastoma multiforme [82]. 
The year 2001 meant 437 new papers for us. Among them, Debrik et al. [83] found 
that PPAR-gamma has a pleiotropic function in the cell, while Chinetti et al. [84] detected 
functions performed by PPARs in blood vessel walls, which have serious health implica tions. Delerive et al. described PPARs in the context of modulation of the inflammatory 
response, which may have potential therapeutic applications in chronic inflammatory 
diseases [85]. The authors reported that PPARs activators participate in anti-inflammatory 
activation in various cell types by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory genes 
such as cytokines, metalloproteases, and acute phase proteins. In addition, PPARs play 
an important role in negatively regulating the transcription of inflammatory response 
genes by antagonizing AP-1, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), a signal transducer and 
activator of transcription, and the nuclear factor signaling pathways of activated T cells. Duez et al. emphasize that PPARs play an essential role in modulating the development 
of atherosclerosis through actions at both the metabolic and vascular levels. PPAR-alpha 
and PPAR-gamma seem to be of the most significant importance in developing this disease, 
with high levels of their expression. Moreover, PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma are involved 
in immunoregulation, vasculitis, and thrombosis associated with atherosclerosis [86]. Also, 
Elangbam et al. presented that PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma receptors have a beneficial 
effect on inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, by regulating the production of 
cytokines, the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, fibrinolysis, and the 
modulation of monocyte-derived macrophages [87]. 
2002: After reading 596 new papers, it can be concluded that, for example, in the review 
by Stumvoll and Haring, we can learn that the occurrence of the PPAR-gamma2—Pro12Ala 
polymorphism has a significant impact on the risk of common type 2 diabetes (T2D). The 
authors emphasized that a thorough understanding of the mechanism of this disease may 
allow for the prevention or improvement of T2D treatment [88]. Roberts et al. demonstrated 
that p38 MAP kinase activation is mediated by PPARα transcription and detectable changes 
in survival and proliferation. Moreover, they presented the problem of how MAP kinases 
interact with nuclear receptors such as PPARα. This process causes coordinate suppression 
of apoptosis and cell cycle progression [89]. On the other hand, Berger and Moller presented 
condensed knowledge about the relationship of PPARs to chronic diseases [90]. According 
to them, the strong therapeutic effects of PPARα and PPARγ agonists benefit systemic 
lipid levels, glucose homeostasis, and atherosclerosis. It was emphasized that PPARα 
activation can effectively alleviate dyslipidemia and that PPARγ agonists reduce insulin 
resistance. However, in the case of PPARδ, the authors suggest that it may also be an 
important therapeutic target for selected patients’ disorders, including cancer, infertility, 
and dyslipidemia. Fauconet et al. conducted studies in two different human bladder cancer 
cell lines, RT4 (derived from a stage I tumor) and T24 (derived from a stage III tumor). VEGF 
(mRNA and protein) is deferentially increased by the three PPAR isotypes. Additionally, 
the authors reported that only the MEK inhibitor PD98059 downregulated PPAR ligand induced VEGF expression [91]. Moreover, Haydon et al. [92] showed that PPARγ agonists 
are excellent therapy for human osteosarcoma, the biggest metastasis problem in many 
late carcinomas, while Koumanis et al. [93] looked at correlations between overweight 
groups and mortality in association with PPAR G2 Pro12Ala genotypes. In contrast, Berger 
& Wagner [94] described both the health-promoting and pathogenic properties of PPARs. 
In the following year, 2003, out of a group of 711, we considered the following to be 
particularly important. One is an article in which Francis et al. conducted clinical trials in 
which it was shown that only PPARα agonists improved the prognosis of atherosclerotic 
heart disease [95]. Another noteworthy work concerns PPAR-gamma ligands and their 
role as modulators in future cancer treatment strategies. Margeli et al. demonstrated the
Biomolecules 2024, 14, 786 9 of 34 
importance of PPAR-gamma in cell proliferation and cancer, establishing their anticancer 
properties against a wide range of cancer cells [96]. The following paper outlines the 
problem of using PPAR-gamma agonists thiazolidinediones (TZDs) to treat type 2 diabetes. Despite the use of TZDs and their ability to reduce and slow down the progression of 
insulin resistance, including lowering plasma glucose levels and significantly reducing 
triglycerides and free fatty acids in plasma, patients experienced increased body fat. How ever, it is suggested that fat redistribution takes place in a favorable direction, from visceral 
to subcutaneous stores [97]. 
In 2004, 959 fresh scientific reports were published. One of them is an article by Jiang 
et al. that pointed out that PPARγ may play an important role as one of the regulators 
of prostate cancer (PCa) cell differentiation and proliferation. Therefore, PPARγ agonists 
may find use as adjuncts to watchful waiting in selected subpopulations of patients with 
localized PCa [98]. 
In 2005, the number of new works exceeded 1000 when 1297 new papers were pub 
lished. A big part of them seemed to be useful because they focused on the problem of the 
targets. For example, Bedu et al. [99] (co-author W. Wahli) described PPARs β/δ as a thera peutic target, and Tenenbaum et al. [100] used a ligand (H-LDL) to achieve a pan-PPAR 
effect in therapy. Buzzetti et al. examined the association of the PPAR-gamma2 Pro12Ala 
polymorphism with measurements of insulin sensitivity in a population of obese Italian 
children (mean age 10.38 +/− 2.8 years). The authors showed that the X12Ala variant 
(Pro12Ala or Ala12Ala) is significantly associated with greater insulin sensitivity in child hood obesity, which may, therefore, be protected against cardiovascular disease, obesity, 
and diabetes due to the phenotypic effect of the Ala 12 allele on insulin resistance [101]. 
The year 2005 also brought several studies of PPARs-specific ligands. A fascinating 
review paper by Tyagi et al. [102] describes the importance of homocysteine in endocar dial function, structure, and remodeling in conjunction with nitric oxide metabolism in 
diabetic patients with impaired myocyte diastolic relaxation. According to the authors, 
homocysteine antagonizes PPARγ receptors, increasing oxidative stress and decreasing 
endothelial nitric oxide levels. Then nitrotyrosine content and matrix metalloproteinase 
activity in the diabetic heart increase, resulting in myocyte-endothelium disconnection. Harris et al. found that PPAR-gamma activation reduces head and neck cancer proliferation 
through the mechanism of action of 4-hydroxyphenylretinamide (4-HPR, fenretidine) [103]. In turn, Lowe et al. investigated oxazole-substituted indanylacetic acids in the character of 
PPAR-gamma and alpha activator ligand [104]. At the same time, LoVerme et al. showed 
that palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an activator of PPAR-alpha [105]. 
In 2006, the increase in the literature was even more significant, with 1343 new papers, 
of which Michalik et al. [106] (co-author W. Wahli) was selected. They wrote a valuable, 
well-done review in which the authors describe the selective effect of PPAR in vivo, which 
results from the interaction at a given time point between the expression levels of each of the 
three PPAR and RXR isotypes, the affinity for a specific PPRE promoter, and the availability 
of ligands and cofactors. Aung et al. investigated the role of peroxisome proliferator 
activated receptors (PPARs) alpha and beta in differentiating HT-29 colon cancer cells and 
MCF-7 breast cancer cells [107]. The authors concluded that PPAR expression depends on 
the differentiation method and time. These studies have shown that changes in PPAR-alpha 
levels are not required to differentiate colon cancer cell lines, but changes in PPAR-beta are 
more closely related to differentiation. Trivedi et al. presented a different role of PPARs, 
showing that PPARs regulate sebum production. Moreover, this study’s authors believe 
that selectively modulating PPARs activity may constitute a new therapeutic strategy in 
treating acne [108]. Burdick et al.’s review consolidates information on the role of PPAR beta in epithelial tissues. It presents critical discrepancies and how to direct research to 
fully understand how this receptor modulates epithelial homeostasis [109]. 
In 2007, there were 1577 new publications, some of which have vigorously stirred 
our imagination, among them a paper by Michalik and Wahli [110] on the differences of 
PPARs in healthy and diseased (acne, psoriasis, warts, and benign tumors) skin. Akhme-
Biomolecules 2024, 14, 786 10 of 34 
tov et al. [111] claim to have found a link between the athletic performance of athletes 
and several PPAR polymorphisms. It is also worth mentioning the paper of Piqueras 
et al. [112]; they induced endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis using the activation 
of PPARβ/δ by various experimental ligands. In Grarup et al. [113], the authors report that 
in a sample of approximately 7500 white, elderly individuals, 12 polymorphic variants of 
the PPARβ/δ gene correlated with insulin resistance but not with diabetes type. Conversely, 
Hollingshead et al. conducted studies on human cancer cell lines (HT29, HCT116, LS-174T, 
HepG2, and HuH7) cultured in the presence or absence of serum and compared in vitro 
analysis with in vivo analysis. Based on the results obtained (the PPAR-beta/delta ligand 
did not increase cell growth or Akt phosphorylation, nor did it increase the expression of 
VEGF or COX2 in any cell line), the authors of this study concluded that PPAR-beta/delta 
ligands do not enhance tumor formation [114]. 
The year 2008 brought 1633 news items, and research about the relationship between 
PPARs and lung cancer is hidden among them. In one such study, Pedchenko et al. demon strated that PPAR-beta/delta is highly expressed in most lung cancers. Furthermore, 
PPAR activation induces a proliferative response and survival in non-small cell lung can cer [115]. Borland et al. demonstrated that PPAR-beta/delta ligand activation inhibits 
keratinocyte proliferation through a PPAR-beta/delta-independent mechanism. Instead, 
retinoic acid’s inhibition of keratinocyte cell proliferation is mediated through a source of 
PPAR-beta/delta, contradicting the theory that retinoic acid would enhance cell prolifera tion through activation of PPAR-beta/delta [116]. One interesting study was conducted by 
Ahmed et al., who examined the expression of PPAR-beta in terminal ovaries and different 
histological grades of ovarian tumors. The authors of this study found that, unlike other 
cancers such as colon cancer, endometrial cancer, and head cancer, overexpression of PPAR beta does not occur in ovarian tumors [117]. In the same year, Billin wrote a review paper in 
which he summarized the general knowledge available at that time about PPAR-beta/delta 
agonists and properties in the treatment of dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes, as well as 
emerging clinical data on various PPAR-beta/delta agonists. Autor stated that at that time, 
their use in the treatment of dyslipidemia or type 2 diabetes could not be justified [118]. On the other hand, Gallardo-Soler et al. demonstrated that PPAR-γ/δ-mediated uptake 
of modified lipoproteins by monocytes, linking lipid metabolism and immunity, is an 
essential early event in the development of atherosclerosis [119]. In all cells involved in 
the atherosclerotic process, PPARs can modulate immune pathways through at least three 
different mechanisms: by directly binding to PPREs of anti-inflammatory cytokine genes, 
by transrepression of transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1; or by corepression [120]. Interestingly, in vitro studies demonstrated similar changes in AngII-treated macrophages: 
PPARδ activation increased total and free Bcl-6 levels and inhibited AngII activation of 
MAP kinases, p38, and ERK1/2. These studies uncover crucial proinflammatory mecha nisms of AngII and highlight actions of PPARδ activation to inhibit AngII signaling, which 
is atheroprotective [121]. 
In 2009, out of 1666 new papers, we decided to give the following list of outstand 
ing, groundbreaking work: Cavalieri et al. [122] tried to look at the role of PPARs (alpha) 
from the point of view of nutrigenomics, which brought the discussion closer to epigenet ics. A theoretical review paper by Porcuna et al. [123] was finally published in 2021, in 
which the authors point out the great potential of epigenetic tools. In contrast, our first 
practical work in this field dates back to 2022. These studies demonstrated that the effi ciency of PPARγ was increased in adipocytes obtained from insulin and isolated dogwood 
extracts. These results confirm the involvement of PPARγ in the regulation of cellular 
metabolism [124]. An interesting study was carried out by Danesi et al., in which green tea 
extract was added to the cardiomyocyte medium from the first seeding, as a result of which 
this extract selectively activated the PPAR-beta/delta isoform. Thus, the authors of this 
study observed that with the increase accompanied by the activation of PPAR-beta/delta, 
there was a decrease in the production of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and an increase in 
total antioxidant activity. Therefore, it has been suggested that the activation of PPAR-
Biomolecules 2024, 14, 786 11 of 34 
beta/delta may play a key role in reducing NO production [125]. It is worth looking at 
two publications of the same year on the role of PPAR-beta in oxidative stress-induced 
apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In Jiang’s publication, it was 
shown that H2O2 decreased the expression and activation of PPAR-beta, which played an 
essential role in H2O2-induced apoptosis in HUVEC [126]. A few months later, the same 
authors reported that repeated low-level H2O2 stress protected HUVECs from subsequent 
oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by increasing PPARβ expression and activity [127]. In 
turn, Bishop-Bailey and Bystrom summarized the current knowledge about the critical 
role PPAR-beta/delta plays in regulating inflammatory processes and immunity [128]. Ramanan et al. conducted research on patients after whole-brain irradiation (WBI). The 
authors demonstrated that PPARα ligands inhibited or slowed down radiation-induced 
pro-inflammatory responses in microglia in vitro. Moreover, they prevented the harmful 
effects of WBI on hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo, and the PPARγ ligand Pio alleviated 
WBI-induced cognitive impairment [129]. 
In 2010, the scope of knowledge expanded with the results of 1741 new works, in 
cluding the work of Genovese et al. [130], who tested propenoic acid derivatives as PPAR beta/delta agonist ligands. Grimaldi described the regulatory functions of peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor beta in terms of metabolism, inflammation, and cellular 
stress [131]. In his review, the author emphasized that activation of PPARβ using its strong 
and specific agonists prevented and reversed abnormalities associated with the metabolic 
syndrome. Therefore, both genomic and non-genomic modes of action can modulate 
responses to metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative stress in several tissues. An inter esting study was conducted by McKinnon et al., and it was performed on patients with 
endometriosis. The study showed that the expression of PPARγ in peritoneal endometri otic lesions was correlated with pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia experienced 
by patients [132]. This year also brought an exciting paper by Mistry and Cresci, who 
studied PPARs alpha, beta, and gamma to individualize heart failure therapy [133]. It is 
also important to mention the work of Bassaganya-Riera et al., who studied the effect of 
PPAR-gamma on respiratory infections with viruses, which offers potential hope for rescue 
in case of failed viral vector therapies [134]. 
In 2011, 1672 papers were published, mainly on the role of PPARs in lipid metabolism, 
inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Clinically significant papers were precious. The role of T-cell PPARγ in lymphopenia-associated autoimmunity was determined for 
the first time. Housley et al. examined the role of PPARγ in CD4+ T cells and found that 
PPARγ expression in CD4+ CD25− T cells (Teff) is required to develop autoimmunity 
under lymphopenia. However, an unexpected function for PPARγ in Teff, in contrast to the 
documented immunosuppressive role of PPARγ, was found in increased Teff proliferation 
and survival [135]. A clinically valuable study of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated 
with pioglitazone showed a significant reduction in serum oxidative and inflammatory 
parameters and a significant improvement in DAS28 compared to the placebo group [136]. In turn, Sertznig and Reichrath presented an exciting summary of the effects of PPAR 
agonists in dermatology. This review summarizes the current knowledge of PPAR functions 
in various skin disorders, particularly inflammation and epidermal hyperproliferation (i.e., 
psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, acne, scleroderma, skin malignancies) [137]. 
In 2012, 1845 relatively fresh results arrived; the selected works are described below. 
First, Laschke and Menger [138] had developed a strategy for the use of PPARs in antian giogenic therapy of endometriosis, while Nickkho-Amiry et al. addressed the modulation 
of PPARs, which reduces the growth of endometrial cancer cells [139]. Moreover, Knapp 
et al. [140] showed higher expression of PPARα and PPARβ and lower expression of PPARγ 
in patients with endometrial cancer than in patients with healthy endometrium. Addition ally, Montero et al. [141] demonstrated that activation of PPARα and PPARγ modulates 
the expression of the human equilibrium nucleoside transporter hENT1, which plays a 
vital role in chemotherapy. Then Abbas et al. [142] found that a PPARγ agonist can both 
reduce and increase the risk of cardiovascular events, while Chen et al. [143] studied PPARγ
Biomolecules 2024, 14, 786 12 of 34 
receptors in neurodegenerative diseases, finding them to have a significant effect through 
NF-kappa beta. Additionally, Greene et al. [144] proved that the level of PPARδ increased 
during intense strength training and was negatively correlated with the concentration of 
total cholesterol and LDL, especially in the untrained state. In contrast, the level of PPARα 
increased intensively after exercise training. 
Wadosky and Willis [145] showed in their paper that post-translational regulation of 
PPARs undergoes ubiquitination and sumoylation, and Peyrou et al. have dealt with PPARs 
in liver disease and found that they are essential in metabolic dysregulation [146]. Costa 
and Ciccodicola, on the other hand, investigated whether PPARγ is essential to diabetic 
retinopathy, finding, however, a beneficial role [147]. Then Balakumar and Mahadevan [148] 
argued in their paper that PPARs may be involved in the action of statins by showing anti 
inflammatory, antioxidant, and antifibrotic effects. Wahli and Michalik [149], on the other 
hand, consider PPARs to be the main regulator of whole body metabolism. Furthermore, 
Reichenbach et al. [150] showed that the PPARα agonist Wy14643 inhibits cathepsin B 
protein expression in endothelial cells. Then, Taiileux et al. [151] claimed that PPARs 
have potential clinical applications in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, as evidenced by 
their participation in modulating triglyceride accumulation. Vidella and Petinelli also 
mentioned the role of PPARs in NAFLD [152]. In this work, the authors showed that the 
reduction of PPARα levels is associated with the depletion of the n-3 polyunsaturated 
fatty acid chain, which may play a role in increasing the DNA binding capacity of the 
pro-inflammatory factors NFκB and AP-1, thus constituting one of the main mechanisms of 
progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis. PPARs also play a role in neurological diseases, as demonstrated by Bedendusi et al. [153]. The authors of this study proved that the 
progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) leads to the activation of PPARγ in motor 
neurons, which contributes to the increase in the activity of lipid detoxifying enzymes, 
such as lipoprotein lipase and glutathione S-transferase α-2. PPARs may participate in the 
regulation of viral expression, as evidenced by the publication of Hu et al. [154] regarding 
the HBV virus. This experiment showed that PPARα regulates HBV gene expression 
through interactions with regulatory elements of the HBV promoter. Interestingly, Zuo 
et al. demonstrated that the induction of heat injury in fibroblasts activates the action of 
PPARβ, which has a protective effect on the structure and proliferation of these cells [155]. The same was true in 2013, with 1845 new papers, including the selected ones, such as 
the paper by Le Foll et al. [156], which analyzed the potential use of peroxisome proliferator 
activated receptor (PPAR) agonists as promising new drugs in the treatment of psychoactive 
substance dependence based on preclinical studies. Aleshin and Reiser [157] described the 
roles of all PPAR isoforms. They addressed the regulation of oxygen signaling in the brain 
through pan-PPARs. The paper of Contreras et al. describes PPAR-alpha in the context of 
the key to metabolic and environmental adaptations of disease substrates [158], and the 
paper of Akyurek et al. describes PPAR-gamma in overweight children. These researchers 
found that PPAR-gamma levels in obese children were low [159]. 
In 2014 we can find 1688 research papers focused on PPAR, some showing the im 
portance of PPARs in anticancer treatment. One such study was conducted by Yao et al. on human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231—estrogen receptor-negative and MCF7— estrogen receptor positive), where they showed that ligand activation and/or overexpres 
sion of PPARβ/δ inhibits the relative carcinogenicity of breast cancer and provides further 
support for the development of PPARβ/δ ligands to specifically inhibit breast carcino 
genesis [160]. In addition, research into the treatment of HCV virus has been carried out. 
Researchers have shown that using fluoxetine, an HCV titer-lowering drug, also increases 
the activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) response element in 
HCV infection [161]. 
In 2015—1742 papers were published. One was Montagner et al.‘s paper, which 
reviews peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARβ/δ function in skin wound 
healing and cancer. The work highlights the significant role of PPARβ/δ in inhibiting 
keratinocyte apoptosis at the wound edges through activation of the PI3K/PKBα/Akt1
Biomolecules 2024, 14, 786 13 of 34 
pathway and its role during re-epithelialization in regulating keratinocyte adhesion and 
migration. The observations and analyses suggest the need to evaluate modulators of 
PPARβ/δ that attenuate or enhance its activity, depending on the therapeutic target [162]. 
In 2016, 1643 works were published. An exciting publication concerns the use of 
nanoparticles to enhance the anti-inflammatory potential of one of the PPARγ agonists— 15-deoxy-∆12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). Using solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and 
15d-PGJ2 at low concentrations, 15d-PGJ2-SLN was developed and investigated for its 
immunomodulatory potential. In three inflammation models, 15d-PGJ2-SLN reduced 
neutrophil migration, increased IL-10 levels, and reduced IL-1β and IL-17 in peritoneal 
fluid. Therefore, using SLN may improve the therapeutic properties of the 15d-PGJ2 [163]. Also, in 2016, Xue et al. constructed the peptide-functionalized nanoparticle platform to 
deliver PPARγ activator rosiglitazone to adipose tissue vasculature [164]. This system 
promotes the transformation of white adipose tissue into brown-like adipose tissue and 
angiogenesis, which facilitates the homing of targeted NPs to adipose angiogenic vessels, 
thereby amplifying their delivery. In a diet-induced obese mouse model, compared with 
the control group, these angiogenesis-targeted NPs inhibited body weight gain and modu 
lated several serological markers, including lipids and insulin. These findings suggest that 
angiogenesis-targeting moieties with angiogenic stimulator-loaded NPs could be incorpo 
rated into the clinical treatment of obesity and other metabolic diseases. A different type of 
carrier, i.e., diamond nanoparticles (DN) was used by Strojna et al. concerning the delivery 
of curcumin to cells [165]. The major problem with curcumin is its poor bioavailability, 
which can be improved by adding carriers. DN are large surfaces that are non-toxic, have 
antiangiogenic properties, and create bio-complexes through a fast and straightforward 
process of self-organization. The authors investigated the cytotoxicity of complexes of 
curcumin with DN against liver cancer cells and normal fibroblasts. Preliminary results 
confirmed the applicability of DN as an efficient carrier of curcumin, which improves its 
performance against cancer cells in vitro. 
In 2017, 1606 papers were published. This year, Fidoamoere et al. [166] elucidated 
the role of PPAR-alpha in metabolic alterations of the oxygen-deficient microenviron 
ment in newly formed tumors. The same problem was revisited 6 years later by Rolver 
et al. [167], who looked at the issue of creating, with the help of PPAR-alpha, an acidic 
microenvironment that favors young tumors. In the same year, Kado et al. [168] proposed 
to reduce ovarian cancer progression using the exact mechanism. Wright et al. researched 
human oral cancer cell lines CA-9-22 and NA, which were treated with the PPAR activators 
eicosatetraenoic acid (ETYA), 15-deoxy-δ-12,14-prostaglandin J2 (PG-J2), thiazolidinedione, 
and ciglitazone, and then tested on their ability to functionally activate PPARγ luciferase 
reporter gene constructs. The authors found a significant reduction in cell proliferation 
and clonogenic potential and concluded that with treatment, there was a decrease in cell 
proliferation and clonogenic potential [169]. A fascinating paper by Ivanova et al. describes 
the activation of PPARs in fatty acid and energy metabolism, stating that PPAR-gamma 
activation is related to atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disorders, and prognosis of cardio 
vascular surgery [170]. Gross et al. reported that PPAR ligands reduce comorbid disease 
by affecting WAT combustion storage capacity and fat combustion in BAT and/or periph eral possessions, thereby reducing ectopic fat load. Moreover, a well-prepared clinical 
study showed that the use of PPARγ has a beneficial effect in patients with non-alcoholic 
steatomyelitis [171]. 
The year 2018 brought us 1608 research papers. For example, Borland et al. showed 
that PPARs have a significant impact on carcinogenicity in squamous cell carcinoma [172]. The authors presented their results on the A431 human squamous cell carcinoma cell line, which showed that stable expression and activation of PPARβ/δ or PPARγ led to reduced 
carcinogenicity. Furthermore, Leiguez et al. found that in macrophages, the compound 
MT-III, snake venom phospholipase A2, activated PPARγ and PPARβ/δ and increased 
protein levels of both transcription factors and CD36 [173]. According to studies conducted 
by Sun et al. on the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, it is suggested
Biomolecules 2024, 14, 786 14 of 34 
that using 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid interferes with glucose metabolism in the liver 
by activating PPARβ [174]. Therefore, it leads to hepatocyte glycogen accumulation by 
increasing glucose uptake and improving gluconeogenesis (via FoxO1 and CREB). 
2019 was particularly abundant in new (1509) and especially in critical reports, of 
which we have selected a few for presentation. One of the exciting and valuable publica tions is a review in which the authors present the issues related to chemotherapy-induced 
neuropathy and the effects of PPARγ activation in treating chemotherapy-induced neuro pathic pain [175]. Vallée, et al. demonstrated that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
acting as PPARγ agonists help regulate the WNT/β-catenin pathway and thus control 
tumor growth through cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation, and apoptosis and may reduce 
inflammation, oxidative stress, proliferation, invasion, and cell migration [176]. 
The year 2020 brought 1460 new papers. We found many publications dated that year 
on the links between PPARs and various types of cancer. One of them is an interesting 
work of Toraih et al. [177], who addressed the relationship between genotype and clinical 
prognosis of thyroid cancer patients, finding in a material analysis of 174 samples that the 
simultaneous presence of micro RNA 27a (miRNA 27a) and PPAR-alpha and RXR-alpha 
dimer are associated with adverse clinical prognosis. Hirao-Suzuki et al. demonstrated in 
the MDA-MB-23 human breast cancer cell model that COX-2 expression is positively mod ulated by PPARβ/δ-mediated signaling [178]. Moreover, Elie-Caille et al., using RTqPCR 
and Western blot analyses, showed that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ 
(PPARβ/δ) agonist GW501516 significantly reduced the expression of N-cadherin in the 
transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary epithelium of the bladder [179]. Moosavi et al. reported that in studies of Cao2 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, extracellular vehicles EVs 
derived from gut microbiota such as F. prausnitzii increase the permeability of the intestinal 
barrier, among others, through the PPARα, PPARγ and PPAR β/δ genes [180]. Addition ally, Liu et al. demonstrated that genetic variants in PPAR pathway genes, particularly 
MED1, PRKCA, and PRKCB, may contribute to susceptibility to pancreatic cancer [181]. Wouters et al. demonstrated that inflammation-induced PPARγ expression promotes 
myelin-induced foam cell formation in macrophages in multiple sclerosis [182]. PPARs are 
also associated with liver disease. Xia et al. showed that bergenine may be a promising 
drug candidate for treating liver fibrosis because it activated PPARγ, inhibited TGF-β, 
and reduced liver fibrosis by inhibiting hepatocyte necrosis and extracellular matrix for 
mation [183]. In studies conducted in hepatocytes treated with non-esterified fatty acids, 
Shen et al. showed that choline and methionine regulate the transcriptional activity of 
PPARα and liver X receptor α (LXR-α) through phosphorylation of AMPK-α and regulate 
SREBP-1c independently of AMPK-α to promote lipid oxidation and transport [184]. Yu 
et al. showed that PPARβ/δ activating ligands increase the in vitro expression of decidual ization biomarkers of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs), and PPARβ/δ antagonists impair 
decidualization markers [185]. In addition, Zhang et al. showed that the expression of 
PPARβ/δ was significantly increased in cholesteatoma, and the ligand-activated PPARβ/δ 
promoted the proliferation of cholesteatoma keratinocytes as a result of the positive reg ulation of the PDK1/PTEN/AKT/GSK3β/cyclin D1 pathway [186]. In the same year, 
Wójtowicz et al. [187] proposed using the PPARs in treating neurodegenerative disorders. More Manickam et al. [188] studied the effect of microbiota on skeletal muscle status, da 
Cruz et al. [189] attempted to control inflammatory processes through PPARβ/δ and ma nipulation of it with diet, and Wagner and Wagner [190] studied PPARβ/δ as a hallmark of 
cancer. In this news-rich year, additional mention should be made of Phua et al. [191] work 
(co-author W. Wahli), in which a PPARβ/δ agonist reduces inflammation in skeletal muscle. Additionally, Zhang et al. researched new biomarkers of myocardial damage. In this 
work, they demonstrated that small molecules transform myocardial energy metabolism 
by regulating and translating PPARα [192]. Interestingly, Andrade-Souza et al. researched 
the effects of exercise on nuclear transcription factors. Studies have shown that PPARα 
and PPARβ/δ gene transcriptions were increased when exercise was performed twice a 
day compared to once a day [193]. Furthermore, Faulkner et al. showed that in the human
Biomolecules 2024, 14, 786 15 of 34 
endothelial cell line HUVEC, the tubulogenic effects of compound GW0742 were dependent 
on PPARβ/δ and demonstrated a regulatory role for PPARβ/δ in regulating endothelial 
cell behavior and promoting tissue maintenance and repair [194]. In addition, Chai et al. showed that microRNA-9-5p inhibits extracellular matrix deposition and proliferation and 
induces apoptosis by targeting PPARβ in human hypertrophic scar fibroblasts [195]. It also 
turns out that PPARs have a potential role in treating diabetic retinopathy, as discovered 
by Capozzi et al. [196]. In this study, the authors showed that the PPARβ/δ inhibitor— GSK0660 inhibits the palmitic acid-stimulated production of inflammatory mediators by 
Müller cells. However, Contreras-Lopez et al. demonstrated a different property of PPARs. In their studies, the authors showed that PPARβ/δ participates in the regulation of the 
immunoregulatory potential of mesenchymal stem cells, therefore dictating their metabolic 
reprogramming and paving the way to enhance the immunoregulatory properties of MSCs 
and counteract their versatility [197]. Also of note from this year is the work of Petr et al., 
who studied the effect of genetic variants of PPARs on the performance of athletes [198]. In 
addition, Tutunchi et al. [199] reviewed the effects of oleoylethanolamide, a PPARα ligand, 
as a weight control agent. 
There were 1404 newcomers in 2021, among which the following papers should be 
mentioned: Grabacka et al. [200] found that PPAR-alpha plays a key role in the processes 
of the innate immune response, and Willems et al. [201] highlighted the possibility of 
modifying PPAR-alpha (and also beta/delta) activity with photohormones. Kharbanda 
et al. [202] synthesized forty-eight molecules derived from the arylpropionic acid scaffold 
and evaluated them for their effects on diabetes based on the excellent docking point 
demonstrated by all structures made to the PPAR-γ receptor site. The authors concluded 
that arylpropionic acid derivatives may provide a new perspective toward developing 
antidiabetic agents with fewer side effects. 
Several interesting review papers were also published in 2021. Christofides et al. [203] 
described the role of PPARs in immune responses, Rayner et al. [204] described PPAR 
gamma-mediated neuronal regeneration, and Stark et al., in turn, described the role of 
PPAR-gamma in allergic diseases [205]. This year also saw the work of Hasegawa et al. who looked at liver diseases and described several potential new drugs using PPARs [206]. 2022 was one of the peak years for publications on PPARs, with about 1555 of them 
recorded in the NCBI database. In our opinion, the most noteworthy are the papers 
regarding the relationships between non-coding RNA and PPARs. Previously, few works 
on this topic were published, but in 2022, according to NCBI, there were 146 of them. Therefore, review works are precious, especially those that concern common diseases 
whose pathogenesis is very complex and whose therapeutic goals are challenging to 
achieve. Such diseases include NAFLD, the most prevalent form of chronic liver disease 
in the world and a significant risk factor for developing hepatocellular carcinoma, and 
NASH. Non-coding, such as microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), 
has been proven to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. PPARs 
were found to be one of the major regulators in the progression of NAFLD. Mukherjee 
et al. presented reliable knowledge about regulating PPARs through ncRNAs and their role 
in NAFLD [207]. In the review on the clinical relevance of circulating non-coding RNAs 
in metabolic diseases (such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic 
syndrome), Dandare cites that miRNA-138 suppresses adipogenic differentiation and is 
implicated in obesity by interaction with a potent inhibitor of adipogenic differentiation 
that interferes with Src homology region 2-containing protein (SHP2), an endogenous 
enhancer of adipogenic PPARγ [208]. A fascinating paper concerns miRNA networks, 
which form networks of systems and gene expression circuits through molecular signaling 
and cellular interactions and contribute to various health disorders [209]. It appears 
necessary to establish genomic signatures to determine multifactorial correlations and 
reveal variability observed in therapeutic effects, e.g., in patients with cardiovascular 
disease. Clinically validated miRNA biomarkers and relevant SNPs identified in clinical 
practice can serve this purpose. They should increase the ability to stratify patients, help
Biomolecules 2024, 14, 786 16 of 34 
select innovative therapeutic regimens, and identify innovative drugs and delivery systems. This paper examines miRNA–gene networks and SNP-derived genomic signatures to 
highlight specific gene signaling circuits as sources of molecular knowledge relevant to 
cardiovascular diseases. 
The year 2023 resulted in 1310 new publications. We think the following should be 
mentioned: Kaltdorf et al. [210] proposed a new approach to evaluating experiments using 
PPARs and a new informatics tool called Boolean networks. Tanaka et al. reported [211] 
on PPARα and its ligand Ror 1, Ibrahim et al. [212] on the activation of SIRT 1 by taurine, 
and Yang et al. [213] on the effect of ligand PFAS (polyfluorolkyl) on the PPARα/ACOX 1 
heteroduplex. Zhou et al. [214] described the impact of the FNDC5/PARGα heterodimer 
on macrophage pyroptosis. Nevertheless, in our ranking, the champions of 2023 were 
Pascoa et al. [215], presenting their prototype tool for identifying new ligands detected in 
cyanobacteria. 
In 2024 (data from January to May 20, includes 385 papers), Kim et al. [216] elucidated 
the mechanism of PPAR-alpha’s effect on the intestinal stem cell pool in the process of 
calcification of blood vessels, while Liu et al. [217] tackled pectolinargenine, a Chinese 
folk medicine drug, demonstrating its multiple beneficial effects in many disease entities, 
including ligands and with the Nrf 2 gene. Exciting research was conducted by Cheng 
et al. [218], in which they led the study of the role of epigenetic regulation, including DNA 
methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a)-mediated methylation and PPARγ-activated receptor 
inhibition, in the development of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). The authors 
of this study showed that DNMT3a, by modifying the hypermethylation of the PPARγ 
promoter, activates the NF-κB pathway and thus contributes to apoptosis and degradation 
of the extracellular matrix. 
In reviewing the literature, a trend in research has been noted: Chinese researchers are 
often concerned with green tea and drugs used in folk traditional Chinese medicine [219–226]. Indians, on the other hand, are keen on traditional medicines used in Ayurveda (mainly 
curcumin) [227–229]. Europeans, on the other hand, often try to demonstrate the beneficial 
effects of cannabis [230–235]. 
Examining this phenomenon in light of the statements about the lack of conflict of 
interest might be worthwhile. 
4. Discussion 
In a situation with so much interest in PPARs and such a huge scattering of detailed 
research topics, it is tough to summarize the results to date, let alone predict the future. Nevertheless, some things can be expected with reasonable probability. First, in pure 
science, it is possible to foresee a slow filling of the small gaps in knowledge that still exist. Second, in the field of pharmacology, there will be an acceleration of work on the search 
for new and better ligands, with little harm to human health. It is also most likely that 
pan-type approaches will become more common. In conclusion, the field is slowly moving 
from research to implementation, which bodes well for patients. 
PPARα is a crucial regulator of lipid metabolism. It was discovered as the first member 
of the peroxisome proliferator family [236]. PPARα is mainly expressed in the liver and 
tissues with increased mitochondrial oxidation and fatty acid catabolism, such as brown 
adipocytes, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and kidney [237]. PPARα activation leads 
to the upregulation of enzymes involved in fatty acid uptake, transport to mitochondria, 
and subsequent oxidation. This stimulates the breakdown of fatty acids, especially during 
fasting or prolonged exercise when glucose availability is limited and energy is needed. In 
addition, PPARα activation enhances the removal of circulating triglycerides in the blood 
by increasing the expression of lipoprotein lipase and other lipolytic enzymes, thereby 
lowering plasma lipid levels. 
PPARγ is expressed in adipose tissue, the colon, the immune system, and the retina. 
Alternative splicing results in seven different mRNA transcript variants named PPARγ1 to 
PPARγ7 [238]. PPARγ influences the development, body localization, and adipose tissue
Biomolecules 2024, 14, 786 17 of 34 
metabolism [239]. In addition, it is a significant insulin sensitizer and regulates metabolism 
and cellular sensitivity to glucose and insulin. Moreover, PPARγ plays a vital role in cell 
differentiation and the regulation of apoptosis. Another function of PPARγ is to inhibit 
inflammatory processes, have an anti-atherosclerotic effect, and generally improve cardiac 
performance. PPARγ also plays an important role in human procreation (in women, it 
stimulates ovulation, while in men, it regulates sperm biology). When activated by specific 
ligands, PPARγ binds to the RXR receptor to form a heterodimer, and together, they regulate 
the expression of multiple genes [15,239]. The same can be observed in PPARα. Ligands for 
PPARγ can be both natural compounds (docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid 
or other polyunsaturated fatty acids and some monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic 
acid) and synthetic compounds (thiazolidinediones such as troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and 
pioglitazone) [240]. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also included in the PPARγ 
agonist group. 
Numerous studies published to date point to the critical role of DNA methylation in 
regulating the expression and normal function of PPARγ in health and homeostasis by 
regulating many important vital processes [241–243]. PPARγ is also believed to play a 
massive role in the pathogenesis of many diseases in which dysregulation of DNA methy lation leading to impaired expression disrupts the normal function of the transcription 
factor. Such disorders include insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and the epigenetic 
component plays a significant role in their development. Epigenetics are those changes in 
gene function inherited by mitotic or meiotic cells, which are not associated with changes 
in DNA sequence [244]. Such changes can increase or decrease the expression of a target 
gene [245]. DNA methylation profiles are greatly influenced by environmental factors. They 
also affect histone modification, leading to dysregulation of the expression of many genes, including the insulin signaling gene and lipid metabolism genes. In addition to metabolic 
disorders, epigenetics has been linked to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases [244]. 
PPARγ and PPARα homologs are subject to epigenetic regulation, mainly DNA methy 
lation [123]. The PPARα promoter is hypermethylated, mainly in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and patients with type 2 diabetes [246,247]. PPARα 
undergoes hydroxymethylation, which affects PPARα expression, predisposing a person to 
NAFLD [248]. Patients with metabolic syndrome have been found to have significant hyper lipidemia dependent on a different DNA methylation of PPARα [249]. Castellano-Castillo 
et al. demonstrated hypermethylation of multiple genes that correlated with metabolic 
dysregulation, including genes essential for regulating adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, and 
inflammation. This suggests that DNA methylation of the nuclear receptors PPARγ and 
PPARα is correlated with metabolic deregulation, the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, and the induction of inflammation [250]. 
Considering diabetes treatment, it is known that the use of an adjuvant PPAR agonist 
influences the control of glycemia, the reduction of HbA1c levels, and the improvement 
of insulin resistance compared to metformin monotherapy. Moreover, beneficial changes 
were observed in patients using PPAR agonists, such as a reduction in blood pressure 
and a decrease in the concentration of inflammatory markers and dyslipidemia. It was 
mentioned above that in the treatment of diabetes, PPARy agonists can be used, mainly 
thiazolidinediones (TZD), whose task is to prevent the effects of diabetes by increasing 
patients’ sensitivity to insulin, leading to a reduction in the concentration of both glucose 
and insulin in the plasma. The most commonly used TZDs are rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and lobeglitazone sulfate in combination with metformin and other drugs used to treat 
diabetes [251]. Despite the positive effects of rosiglizatone, such as lowering fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG) and postprandial serum glucose, lowering HbA1c, and lowering insulin and 
C-peptide levels, this drug has clinically significant side effects such as edema, anemia, and weight gain [252]. Additionally, an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has 
been observed in patients with unstable heart failure (HF) [253]. In turn, pioglitazone has 
antidiabetic effects, improves HbA1c, and has a positive effect on serum lipids; however, 
increasing the duration of pioglitazone use resulted in an increased risk of bladder can-
Biomolecules 2024, 14, 786 18 of 34 
cer [254]. Nevertheless, unlike other TZDs, it has been shown that lobeglitazone can be a 
therapeutic substance that combines the features of both effectiveness and safety [255]. No 
side or carcinogenic effects were observed in patients taking it, but its antidiabetic effects 
have been proven [256]. 
The effect of PPAR agonists in treating diabetes may depend on individual factors 
such as single nucleotide polymorphism. One of the most frequently studied and analyzed 
polymorphisms is Pro12Ala, in which there is a nucleotide change from CCA-to-GCA in 
the codon12 of exon B of the PPARG gene [257]. Multiple studies have shown that the 
occurrence of this polymorphism was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes as 
well as improved insulin sensitivity in humans, suggesting that this amino acid change 
enhances the action of insulin [258,259]. Additionally, it was shown that the occurrence 
of the Pro12Ala polymorphism was associated with a decrease in triglyceride content in 
white adipose tissue, skeletal muscles, and the liver, which was the result of increased 
leptin expression and a decrease in the lipogenesis process, which led to increased insulin 
sensitivity [257]. The reduction in immune function may result from several mechanisms. As mentioned earlier, pioglitazone is used to reduce insulin sensitivity in diabetes. Nu merous studies also show that patients with the Pro12Ala polymorphism showed a better 
therapeutic response than participants with the Pro12Pro genotype [257]. Additionally, 
many studies show that the Pro12Ala polymorphism significantly impacts changes in 
HbA1C, FPG, and TG levels in T2D patients treated with TZD4 [260]. 
Particular attention should be paid to the importance of pharmacogenetics, which will 
make individual treatment based on the patient’s genetic profile possible in the future. 
PPARs, playing an essential role in regulating the inflammatory response, have a 
significant impact on the course of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis [75,136,261–263] 
and inflammatory bowel diseases [264–268]. In the synovium of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
patients, the abnormal migration, proliferation, and activation of fibroblast-like synovio cytes (FLSs) is observed in the joints. In vitro studies demonstrated that the expression of 
PPAR-γ in the synoviocytes of RA patients and adjuvant arthritis (AA) in experimental 
animals was significantly lower than that of normal FLSs [263,267]. Synthetic non-fibrate 
PPARγ ligands (thiazolidinedione family) and fibrates (bezafibrate and fenofibrate), as well 
as natural PPAR agonists (unsaturated and nitrated fatty acids, eicosanoids), had various 
effects on the severity and course of RA. In the synoviocytes of RA patients, the induction 
of inflammatory cytokine mRNA expressions such as TNF-α and IL-1β was significantly 
inhibited by the 15d-PGJ2, natural PPARγ agonist [261,269]. Using solid lipid nanoparticles 
may enhance this anti-inflammatory effect of 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone [163]. A recent 
study has shown that PPARγ alleviates the inflammatory response in TNF-α-induced FLSs 
by binding to p53 in RA patients [270]. Another study indicated that PPARγ may induce 
the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling during FLSs activation [176,263]; perhaps in this 
way, PPARγ ligands induce synovial cell apoptosis. 
Study results support the use of PPARγ agonists in the treatment of RA. Their beneficial 
effects, especially in combination with methotrexate, are documented. The mechanisms of 
this action include the inhibition of ROS and inflammatory cytokines generation, as well as 
the attenuation of the migration and proliferation of FLSs. 
PPARγ is highly expressed in the colon (in epithelial cells and lamina propria mononu 
clear cells such as macrophages as well as T and B cells), being a key regulatory factor 
of bacteria-induced mucosal inflammation. A bacteria-induced excess of TLR4 under the 
influence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers the NFκB and mitogen-activated kinases 
(MAPKs) pathways, leading to increased production of inflammatory mediators. In pa tients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); ulcerative colitis (UC), or Crohn’s 
disease (CD), as well as in experimentally induced colitis, the depressed PPARγ expres 
sion in colon epithelial cells has been shown. Simultaneously, the PPARγ gene has been 
described as a susceptibility gene for IBD [265]. One of the oldest anti-inflammatory agents 
used for the treatment of IBD is 5-ASA, the functional synthetic ligand for PPARγ in the 
colon. PPARγ is the critical receptor mediating the 5-ASA activity by trans-repressing
Biomolecules 2024, 14, 786 19 of 34 
several essential target genes such as NFκB, signal transducers, and activators of transcrip tion [264]. Synthetic (thiazolidinediones, glitazars, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
aspirin) and natural (conjugated linoleic acid, barley leaf (BL), inosine) PPARγ ligands 
were used in various models of IBD, with different effectiveness [264–268]. Rosiglitazone 
was also used in patients suffering from UC, and the endoscopic and clinical results were 
promising [271,272]. As UC is closely associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis, Li et al., using 16S rRNA gene-based microbiota analysis, found that dietary supplementation of BL 
ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and protects 
against DSS-induced colitis. The mechanism of this protective BL action resulted from im proved intestinal mucosal barrier functions via the activation of PPARγ signaling. Similarly 
to the effect of exogenous treatment with inosine, BL protects against DSS-induced colitis 
by improving adenosine 2A receptor/PPARγ-dependent mucosal barrier functions [268]. The conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) induced PPARγ and δ and repressed tumor necrosis 
factor α (TNF-α) expression and NFκB activation while inducing the immunoregulatory 
cytokine transforming growth factor β 1 (TGF-β1). Clinically, CLA also ameliorated DSS and CD4+-induced colitis through a PPAR γ-dependent mechanism [273]. Additionally, 
PPARγ receptors are directly involved in the mechanism of action of mesalazine, which is 
primarily used and effective in UC. 
The impact of PPARγ on the course of IBD seems to pertain not solely to UC but 
also CD. Numerous animal studies have concluded that PPARγ agonists may have higher 
efficacy in maintaining rather than inducing IBD remission and that the therapeutic effect 
of PPARγ is mainly dependent on its abundance in target tissues. 
It is also essential to emphasize the role of PPAR-alpha gene polymorphisms on 
cardiovascular risk. 
The risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) has been suggested to be associated with 
polymorphisms of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. The results were con troversial. In the case-control study, T allele carriers of C161T polymorphism were not 
significantly associated with CHD, while T allele carriers showed a higher risk of acute 
coronary syndrome (ACS). The meta-analysis indicated that compared with CC homozy gous, T allele carriers had lower CHD but higher ACS risk. Other polymorphisms were 
also significantly associated with CHD risk under the dominant model: PPAR-alpha intron 
7G/C polymorphism and L162V polymorphism [274]. The association of PPAR-alpha 
L162V polymorphism with cardiovascular risk may result from genetically conditioned 
changes in lipid metabolism. The serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were 
higher in PPAR-alpha V162 allele carriers in non-diabetic CHD. The increasing effect of the 
PPAR-alpha V162 allele on serum cholesterol levels was weakened with the presence of the 
PPAR-gamma 161T allele in the non-diabetic CHD patients. The ApoE4-PPAR-alpha V162 
allelic combination of the ApoE/PPARA genes was found to be more frequent in diabetic 
CHD patients, independent of serum lipids. It was suggested that the PPAR-alpha L162V 
polymorphism may have diverse effects on serum lipids, and CHD risk depends on the 
presence of diabetes [275]. 
In our study, compared to healthy men, the frequency of the V allele of the L162V 
polymorphism was four times higher in men with confirmed coronary atherosclerosis. We concluded that L162V polymorphism in the gene for PPAR-alpha seems to be associ ated with atherosclerosis through a mechanism including regulation of the interleukin-6 
level [276]. On the other hand, in patients with type 2 diabetes, there was a trend towards a 
lower prevalence of atherosclerosis and lower CHD prevalence in carriers versus noncarri ers of the V allele. These data suggest that the PPAR-alpha polymorphism L162V might 
protect against the development of atherosclerosis or CHD in patients with DM-2 [277]. 
Recently, an increasing number of studies indicate that various PPAR gene polymor 
phisms influence the effects of PPAR agonists on lipids and cardiovascular risk. More over, much evidence shows that lipid metabolism is influenced by gene-gene and gene environment interactions involving PPAR-alpha genes [278].

The data presented above indicate that PPAR-alpha agonists, by reducing metabolic 
disorders associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia, reduce the so-called residual risk of 
cardiovascular events. Currently, scientific societies recommend the use of PPAR-alpha ag 
onists in people with hypertriglyceridemia after the LDL cholesterol level has been reduced 
to the target values. An attempt to reduce the non-HDL cholesterol to the target values 
can be considered (a) combination therapy using omega-3 fatty acids (PUFA, at 2–4 g/day) 
and statin in patients with triglyceride concentrations above 2.3 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) 
despite statin treatment; (b) combination therapy using choline fenofibrate and statin can 
be considered as a part of primary prevention in patients with triglyceride concentrations 
above 2.3 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) whose LDL cholesterol levels have been reduced to the 
Biomolecules 2024, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 21 of 23  
target values, especially where the HDL cholesterol levels are low; (c) combination ther 
apy using choline fenofibrate and statin should be considered in high-risk patients with 
triglyceride concentrations above 2.3 mol/L (200 mg/dL) whose LDL cholesterol levels

low [279,280]. The anti-arthrogenic mechanism of fibrates is shown in Figure 4.

5. Concluding Remarks 
For 35 years, knowledge about PPARs has significantly expanded. Over the years, 
thousands of studies have been performed. PPARs are an exciting group of transcription 
factors due to their connection with various chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, 
obesity, arteriosclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases. PPAR agonists are used to treat 
these diseases. For example, PPARα agonists treat hyperlipidemia or modulation of inflam matory response, while PPARγ agonists have potent hypoglycemic potential in patients 
with insulin resistance and cancer [285]. However, time and many studies are still needed 
to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the long-term use of PPAR agonists. In addition, 
particular attention should be paid to individual variations, such as polymorphisms that 
influence the function of PPARs. However, more research is still needed to fully understand 
the functions of PPARs.
